nstructions

   1.
          * 1

            Open a Terminal window. The Terminal window can be found under "Start" > "Utilities."
          * 2

            Download vnc4server and xinetd:

            sudo apt-get install vnc4server xinetd
          * 3

            Start the vnc4server:

            vnc4server

            You will be prompted for a password. This password will be used to log into the VNC session.

            After providing a password, you will get output that looks like:

            New 'laptop:3 (laptop)' desktop is laptop:3

            Take notice of the number after the colon (:), in this case it is "3."

            Starting the vnc4server will cause a .vnc directory to be placed in your home directory.
          * 4

            Stop the vnc4server

            vnc4server -kill :3

            Replace the number "3" with the number from Step 3.
          * 5

            Open the .vnc/xstartup file for editing:

            gedit ~/.vnc/xstartup

            The file will look like:

            #!/bin/sh

            # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:

            #unset SESSION_MANAGER

            #exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

            [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup

            [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources

            xsetroot -solid grey

            vncconfig -iconic &

            xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &

            twm &
          * 6

            Change the .vnc/xstartup file and save it.

            Uncomment the lines that start with unset and exec. Comment out the lines that start with xsetroot, vncconfig, xterm and twm.

            The final file should look like:

            #!/bin/sh

            # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:

            unset SESSION_MANAGER

            exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

            [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup

            [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources

            #xsetroot -solid grey

            #vncconfig -iconic &

            #xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &

            #twm &
          * 7

            Change the permissions on the /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc file to make it executable:

            sudo chmod 755 /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
          * 8

            Start the vnc4server:

            vnc4server

            Again, remember the number after the colon (:).
          * 9

            Log into your remote desktop to check the configuration:

            vncviewer localhost:3

            Provide the password that you chose in Step 3.
